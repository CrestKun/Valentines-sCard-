		<h1>Hi, my muffin</h1>
		Happy Valentine's Day! I'm very thankful that you came into my life. Until now, I couldn't believe that you were already mine because it felt like a dream. At first, I was just seeing you as my friend, but as time passed, I had this very weird feeling. Every time we go to school to clean up, I'm always finding you. If you were there, then I saw myself happy while looking at your beautiful face. When we're in G10, I think my feelings for you went deeper; this isn't just a crush anymore; that time I realized that I loved you. Every time I saw you with someone, my heart ached, but I don't know why. Maybe that's what they called "love." Then, one day, I took the opportunity to confess my feelings to you. I'm not expecting that you have liked me since then. That's where our love story begins. I just want you to know that I'm not leaving you, no matter what.</p>
